This project has been started to create a compiler for
[Simple-Binary-Encoding](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding)
schema to generate C++(11) code that uses [CommsChampion](https://github.com/arobenko/comms_champion)
project. 

The work is done on "develop" branch and will be release once ready.
Stay tuned.
